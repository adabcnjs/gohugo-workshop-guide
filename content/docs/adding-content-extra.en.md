## Archetypes

Archetypes are basically templates for our content files. For example, if we create a `archetypes/robots.md` file, when doing `hugo new robots/robotname.md` it will use that file as a template. Themes usually provide a _default_ archetype, but some of them give you a few extra ones.

Since archetypes have access to a lot of variables and functions, they can speed up the content creation if you use similar structures on your content.
