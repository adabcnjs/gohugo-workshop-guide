## What is Hugo

Hugo is a framework to build static sites. With it you can generate production-ready sites from markdown files.

## Why Hugo

Hugo has all the benefits from static sites (faster loading, easy search engine crawling), but it makes creating new content very easy.

It also has an amazing build speed compared to other static sites' generators, and has some key features that make it super powerfull!

## Prerrequisites

On this workshop, I'm going to asume you some basic knowledge about:

- HTML
- Git (no shame on using a GUI instead of the console)
- Command line
- Programming concepts (loop, variable...)

Your computer also needs to have:

- Git
- Homebrew (just on Mac)
