## Creating content

There are two ways of adding content to a Hugo site: with Hugo's command line tool or manually.

To add content from the command line run `hugo new robots/killbot.md`. A new file will appear. Try writing on it using markdown syntax and see what happens on your site! (keep running `hugo serve` in a different terminal for a faster development)
